## Introduction

Delve into the realm of "movie data" to uncover the trends that make a movie financially viable! ðŸŽ¬ This project focuses on the box office between 2018 and 2024, exploring worldwide box office earnings, the correlation between movie ratings and box office success, the genres that sell the most, and the correlation between runtime and audience engagement. ðŸ“Š Additionally, it analyzes the effects of the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic eras on box office earnings. ðŸŽ¥

## Background
As a movie-nerd and enthusiast, I aimed to delve into the movie market from the distributor's perspective. ðŸŽ¬ The data I've gathered hails from official box office sources and is packed with insights on popular movie genres and earning trends that occurred within the six years pre and post-pandemic. ðŸ“Š Let's uncover the secrets of the silver screen! ðŸŽ¥

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the movies with the highest worldwide box office from 2018 to now?
2. What are the most popular movie genres since 2018?
3. What is the relationship between movie ratings and box office numbers?
4. What is the correlation between runtime and audience engagement?
5. What is the correlation between sequels and box office numbers?
6. How did the pandemic affect the worldwide box office?

## Tools I used
For my deep dive into the movie data analysis market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

a. SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights. 

b. PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the box office data. 

c. Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

d. Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
